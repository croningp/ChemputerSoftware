:mod:"vacuum_execution" -- Mid-level wrapper class around vaccum pump 
===================================

.. module:: vacuum_execution
   :platform: Windows, Unix
   :synopsis: Mid-level wrapper around vacuum pump control, provides real-live useful methods
.. moduleauthor:: Graham Keenan <1105045k@student.gla.ac.uk>

This class provides all real-life applications of vacuum pumps within the Chemputer rig, essentially
just wrapping the original class methods. It also has a "vent to ambient pressure" function for convenience.
